    "This notebook is intended to introduce you to basic analytic techniques in R within Jupyter notebooks. R is an open-source statistical computing software used to analyze data. A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text that describes the output of our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will introduce some fundamental coding techniques that will help you in this course so that when we cover it again in section, it will not be the first time you have seen it: **this and additional material will be reviewed and covered in more detail in the four coding discussion sections.**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Jupyter and R Basics\n",
    "* When you first log into Datahub, to create a new notebook, click the \"New\" button and select R\n",
    "* All Jupyter Notebooks are comprised of a colelction of boxes called *cells*. We will be working with two types in this course: *Markdown* cells for text and *Code* cells for code.\n",
    "* Select a cell by clicking on it. \n",
    "    * If you click to the left of the cell contents, you will see a blue bar on the left. That means you are in *command mode*. You'll be able to see the Cell type in the dropdown list at the top of the page and you can use command mode keyboard shortcuts. You will not be able to edit the contents of the cell. Pressing `Esc` will take you into command mode.\n",
    "    * If you click in the cell, you'll instead enter *edit mode*. The bar at the left will be green and you will be able to edit the contents of the cell. Pressing `Enter` will take you into edit mode.\n",
    "* Write R script by selecting the option \"Code\" from the dropdown list, or write text by selecting \"Markdown\"\n",
    "* Select \"Insert\" to add a block of text or code\n",
    "* Run code by highlighting and selecting \"Run\"\n",
    "    * You can also use `control+enter` to run a cell, or `shift+enter` to run a cell and automatically select the next cell\n",
    "    * When code is running, you will see an asterisk * to the left of the cell. When it is finished, you will see a number (ex. In [4] is finished; In [*] is still running).\n",
    "* To clear your coding output, select Cell=>All Output=>Clear from the toolbar at the top of the page\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks automatically save periodically, but you can also force it to save with `Control+S`\n",
    "    * You can view the save status at the top of the page next to the notebook name\n",
    "* Close a notebook by selecting File=>Close and Halt.\n",
    "* Some useful guides are here:\n",
    "    * [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for pretty text like in this cell\n",
    "    * [Jupyter Notebook Keyboard Shortcuts](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330)\n",
    "    * Your GSIs refer to these all the time!\n",
